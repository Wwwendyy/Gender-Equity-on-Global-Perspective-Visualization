Welcome to our interactive dashboard on the Gender Equity on Global Perspective. Our dashboard visualizes the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset to explore global perceptions of women's roles in family, politics, education, and business. By focusing on five key questions, we aim to uncover biases and track progress toward gender equality.

This project is developed by Wenjun Dong, Ziyun Yu and Yiru Zhou.
